## Lecture Notes: Malware Persistence Mechanisms

### What is a DLL?

* dynamic link library
* a library that contains code and data that can be used by more than one program at the same time- Microsoft
* PE file format
  * one bit is different than EXEs (is\_DLL)
* used to export/import libraries and functions for programs to extend their capabilities
* can attach DLLs to processes and threads
  * can also specify what happens when detaching the DLLS from processes and threads
  * DLL\_PROCESS\_ATTACH: what happens when you attach the DLL to the process
* when a DLL is called specifically (as seen in the above image), it allows for our PE tools (like CFF Explorer) to see the imports named properly

### DLL Injection

* normal
  * Windows loader is used to load DLL and its imports
    * [LoadLibrary()](pe-files.md#packed-executables)
      * Kernel32.dll
  * DLL is officially registered and can be seen easily in Process Explorer/Process Hacker
  * threat actors often don't use this because they are pulling libraries from elsewhere (the malicious EXE being used, a remote location, etc.)
  * ex. you load kernel32.dll into memory with LoadLibrary-> you want to call CreateProcess -> you use GetProcAddress to locate where CreateProcess is in memory
* API(s) used
  * [GetProcAddress](pe-files.md#packed-executables) -> find LoadLibrary's address
    * Kernel32.dll
  * VirtualAlloc(Ex)
    * locates some space (in an amount defined by the dev) in memory to allocate for the process
    * VirtualAllocEx is used for remote processes (ex. process A is loading process B)
    * usually uses the Windows Memory Manager to find unallocated space, which means that there won't be a conflict between legitimate code in memory and the injected code
  * WriteProcessMemory
  * CreateRemoteThread
    * addr of LoadLibrary
    * Path2DLL
    * used to trigger remote library
* example of benign use: browser extensions being injected to add functionality to your browser

#### How Injection Works

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/{16BF981C-06CA-4B50-9C75-D9BC28D9F1D4}.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* getting the handle of a process is how you access it
  * OpenProcess opens access to the process (not running it)
* allocates memory space in the victim process with VirtualAllocEx() and gets privileges
  * if trying to access a victim process with higher processes, it may be denied
    * must have the same or higher privileges
* WriteProcessMemory() with DLL path to copy the malicious DLL into the victim process (can also load the full DLL)
* execute the malicious DLL in the victim process with CreateRemoteThread()

#### Steps

* step 1: open handle to target process
* step 2: allocate memory to store file path (SeDebug privilege required)
* step 3: find kernel32.LoadLibrary function address
* step 4: use one of several remote thread creation APIs (like CreateRemoteThreadEx) to load DLL into target process's memory space
  * creates new thread and executes LoadLibrary to load DLL
* DLL now runs in target process

### Persistence and Avoiding Detection

* threat actors may target explorer.exe and svchost.exe
  * must have high enough perms
* self-injection
  * the process itself injects itself with other code and overwrites

### Common Autostart Locations

* several locations in registry
  * many locations
    * SYSINTERNALS Autoruns tool lists most of them
  * most common:
    * HKLM or HKCU
      * \Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run or RunOnce
* on file system&#x20;
  * \[Profile]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

### Installing as a Service

* create new service that looks legitimate
  * Svchost1 or svhost or bluetoothd or upnp or dnsservice
* modify ImagePath or ServiceDLL of unused service
  * services like "Distributed Link Tracking" which are not essential or likely to be noticed when disabled

### DLL Search Order

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/{A8D5A94A-E551-46B3-AB55-58A9A7FE8D18}.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Windows uses the Search Order list to locate and load a DLL, which threat actors take advantage of by hijacking
  * looks in memory
  * occurs when only the DLL name is called in WriteProcessMemory, not the DLL path or full DLL
* location info:
  * application's directory: the application may not be located in a default directory- if it's located in the Downloads folder, that will be the application's directory
  * current directory: ex. if an application is run from the Desktop and it exists in the Downloads folder, Desktop will be the current directory
  * %PATH% is an environment variable that defines several directories- allows you to call files from various locations without having to specify the file path (ex. why you can type cmd.exe from anywhere and run it, even though it exists in C:\Windows\System32)
* list -> HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\KnownDLLs
  * defined by Microsoft as system and application critical
    * ex. kernel32.dll, advapi32.dll
* can be hijacked by placing malicious DLLs in the right location
  * placing a Shell extension DLL (loaded by explorer.exe) in the same folder- C:\Windows
    * Windows will search EXE's folder first, then go look at System32

### Hijacking Extension Handlers

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/{DACCC699-21E7-4743-8D8C-6EF31D7E1E2E}.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* change what happens when a file of a specific extension is double-clicked
  * ex. text files are opened in Notepad by default -> change that to a malicious application
* registry modification in HKU
  * doesn't require admin
* can modify for everyone in HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT

### Others

* modify userinit key
  * HLKM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit\userinit.exe -> malware.exe
* register DLL to start with Winlogon
* scheduled tasks
* Powershell scripts
  * Poweliks, Kovtar, etc.
* WMI- Windows Management Interface

## Lab Notes: Call for Help

* change default web browser to Google Chrome
* sample deletes running instances of tools like Wireshark, ProcMon, and ProcExp
* three options:
  * use new tools
  * copy tools to new file locations and rename them
  * patching
* patching
  * open sample with debugger
* API Monitor
  * API Filter Window
    * Find
      * can search for functions as seen in CFF Explorer
  * can save settings so you don't have to reconfigure
  * Monitor New Process -> select process file
    * won't accurately pick up elevation if it was run as admin, since API Monitor is already admin

## Additional Notes

* malware that interacts with existing processes needs to use CreateToolhelp32Snapshot because it takes snapshots of running processes
  * start with Process32First, then Process32Next
    * starts at the first process- if not the right one, moves on
* letters in function names
  * A in a function name indicates ACSII/ANSI
    * 1 byte
  * W in a function name indicates wide characters
    * multiple bytes
  * neither in a function name means that the system will use whichever is needed
* CreateToolhelp32Snapshot
  * handle value is then used when Process32First is called right after
* Process32First/Next
  * can expand LPPROCESSENTRY to see process name
* CreateFileA creating a DLL- why is a file creating a library in C:\Windows\System32? a legitimate program would most likely create a program in Program Files
* SetTime function- can copy time from a legitimate file and change the file timestamps to that same timestamp to have it blend in
* obfuscation: if there is another super common value in the file that isn't 0, the most common value was originally 0 and was XORed by its new value
  * ex. the most common value is 24- that value was 0 and was XORed by 24 to become 24
  * can use 010 Editor for Binary XOR with hex and 24 to deobfuscate
  * ex. dropped file was obfuscated- can deobfuscate and find proper file headers
